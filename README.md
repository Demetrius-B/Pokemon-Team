# How to get this project running on your local machine:
Download or clone the repo to your local machine. cd into 'pokemonteams' then run 'npm install' to install all the dependences.
Using teriminal/cmder run 'npm start' to run the application on localhost.

# How to use PokemonTeams
You will be promted to search or create a store. Once you search or create the application will ask you to login with Facebook or Github.
After logging in if there is no owner to the PokemonTeam then it will make that account you logged in with the owner.
Once inside the PokemonTeam you can use the 'Create new Team' form to create a new team, there is no team limit. 
Once you create a team you can either press the + button or the delete(trash can icon) button. If you press the + button a form will pop up and allow you to add pokemon to that team.
Teams can only have 6 pokemon so if you try to add more than 6 it will error out. Also if you delete a team all the pokemon in that team will be deleted as well.
End of application - Have Fun!
